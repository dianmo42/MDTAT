Platform informationï¼š

CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-10900X

RAM: 64GB

System: Debian GNU/Linux 12

Two compilers were tested:
```
gcc (Debian 12.2.0-14) 12.2.0

Intel(R) oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler 2024.1.0
```

Program that compiled using `icx` was six times faster than `gcc`. Don't know why but Intel oneAPI is recommended.
